## My first internship out of high shool

This was my first internship at 18 years old working with professional collaborators & building a suite of tools to help ad agencies 
automate the management of pay-per-click advertising campaigns. I worked on both the frontend and backend of the project, 
learning as much as I could from this opportunity.

## What I was able to accomplish

- Promoted in the first three months of working at the company due to the quality of my work.
- Built full-stack applications from scratch to automate work for internal departments.
- Hastily learned new languages (TypeScript & PHP) & various other technologies to quickly integrate myself into the agile development process/environment in place.
- Implemented responsive design & ensured cross-browser compatibility on websites built for large companies.
- Participated in code reviews & providing constructive feedback to other developers.
- Learned about server deployment, migration of data between databases, and how to host web applications.

## Looking back, and forward

This was my first full-time job as a software engineer at a larger-scale company. I was quickly thrown into a much more complex 
and agile environment that required me to learn how to take a design and approach it in an efficient manner that would allow me 
to finish the product by a strict due date. This was also my first time building websites from a simple mockup design. Websites 
hastily turned into applications and soon enough I was building backends and APIs for full-stack applications to automate processes 
internally. This opportunity has taught me a lot in terms of tools and technologies such as CloudFlare, MongoDB, Express.js, TypeScript, 
and various hosting services both new and old. Looking forward, I think I would like to move into more of a backend developer role or 
even DevOps. With that in mind, I will close by sayinh I'm always open to new opportunities! Feel free to get in touch via the contact 
form in the website.
