## My first internship out of high school

This was my first internship at 18 years old working with professional collaborators & building a suite of tools to help ad agencies 
automate the management of pay-per-click advertising campaigns. I worked on both the frontend and backend of the project, 
learning as much as I could from this opportunity.

## What I was able to accomplish

- Integrated components in Vue.js in order to execute Figma application designs.
- Worked with Firebase Firestore to manipulate & store data pertaining to consumers of the service.
- Implemented a team system with roles & privileges for more efficient collaboration on campaigns via Firebase.
- Developed cloud functions via Firebase and helped push the product live via Google Cloud Platform.
- Aided in the planning process of building a large-scale application from the ground up.

## Looking back, and forward

This internship gave me an introduction into the process of building a large-scale application from nothing more than an idea. 
Thankfully, I was able to adapt to the agile work environment that was presented and learn new tools, concepts, and habits that 
I still use to this day. I'm grateful for the knowledge the opportunity gave me and the doors it has opened for me. However, I've 
decided it's time to look for new avenues to expand my knowledge and I'm excited to move on to the next chapter in my programming career.
