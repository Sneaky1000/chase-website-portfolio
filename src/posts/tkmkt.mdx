## My first full-time job

This was my first full-time job as a software engineer at a larger-scale company. In fact, this was my first real job ever. I learned more during my first year 
of this job than I did in the first three years of learning how to program. I'm so grateful that I had the opportunity to work with and learn from such 
talented individuals. While working at TurnKey, I developed a new set of skills that I otherwise would have never gotten to if they didn't take the chance on me.

## What I was able to accomplish

- Promoted in the first three months of working at the company due to the quality of my work.
- Built full-stack applications from scratch to automate work for internal departments.
- Hastily learned new languages (TypeScript & PHP) & various other technologies to quickly integrate myself into the agile development process/environment in place.
- Implemented responsive design & ensured cross-browser compatibility on websites built for large companies.
- Participated in code reviews & providing constructive feedback to other developers.
- Learned about server deployment, migration of data between databases, and how to host web applications.

## Looking back, and forward

I was quickly thrown into a much more complex and agile environment that required me to learn how to take a design and approach it in an 
efficient manner that would allow me to finish the product by a strict due date. This was also my first time building websites from a 
simple mockup design. Websites hastily turned into applications and soon enough I was building backends and APIs for full-stack applications 
to automate processes internally. This opportunity has taught me a lot in terms of tools and technologies such as CloudFlare, MongoDB, Express.js, 
TypeScript, and various hosting services both new and old. Looking forward, I think I would like to move into more of a backend developer role or 
even DevOps. With that in mind, I will close by sayinh I'm always open to new opportunities! Feel free to get in touch via the contact 
form in the website.
